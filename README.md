# Optimization-of-an-Integrated-Biorefinery-via-Biomass-Blending
These codes solve a stochastic optimization model to identify a blend of feedstocks, inventory levels, and operating conditions of equipment to ensure a continuous flowing of biomass to the reactor while meeting the requirements of the biochemical conversion process.
